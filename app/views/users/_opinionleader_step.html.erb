           <h3>Informative Twitter accounts</h3>
               <div id="opinion_leader">The Twitter accounts of these persons convey news in ways that lead to learning about news stories and their backgrounds. They express themselves clearly and to the point.
               They provide news content first and then an explanation or background information. They take the time to reply as completely as possible (e.g., adding relevant links) and
               do not leave you feeling that they were too busy to answer your inquiry. They enjoy and are willing to share any information that they have. <p></p></div>
