<b> Dear participant,</b> 
<p>
Thank you for agreeing to take part in this survey, which is being conducted in the context of my dissertation. 
<p>
The goal of this questionnaire is to investigate the personal behavior on Twitter. 
You will be asked several questions related to your demographics and your Twitter usage. Furthermore an experimental part will be shown. In that section you will see a Twitter page and be required to act like you were on Twitter. 
<p>
<h3><b>PLEASE NOTICE: None of your actions on that pages will be published on your Twitter profile. Your answers will remain anonymous and I will use them for research purposes only.</b>
</h3><p>
All in all, the survey should take approximately 10 minutes.
<p>
<p>

Thanks a lot for your support!
