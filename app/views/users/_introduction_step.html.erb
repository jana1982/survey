<b> Dear participant,</b> 
<p>
Thank you for agreeing to take part in this survey that is being conducted in the context of my dissertation. 
<p>
The goal of this questionnaire is to investigate personal behavior on Twitter. 
You will be asked several questions related to your demographics and your Twitter usage. Furthermore, an experiment will follow. You will see a Twitter page and be required to act as if you were on your Twitter account. 
<p>
<h3><b>PLEASE NOTICE: None of your actions on those pages will be published on your Twitter profile. Your answers will remain anonymous, and I will use them for research purposes only.</b>
</h3><p>
All in all, the survey should take approximately 30 minutes.
<p>
<h3>If you like to see previous pages again, please use the Back button at the bottom of the page. The Back button of the browser can cause confusion.</h3>
</p>
<p></p>

Thank you very much for your support!
